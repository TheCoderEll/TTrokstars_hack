First = I made a button in javascript but it didnt word because of chrome's Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB)
Solution = Instead of using the raw version of the file I used the github pages version
Next = I made a function to get the question then answer it and put it into my game
Location = https://github.com/TheCoderEll/TTrokstars_hack/blob/main/V1.0.0.js#L1
Finally = I fixed most the bugs and it is ready to be used
